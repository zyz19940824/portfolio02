# Portfolio

## Line Chart & Area Chart

**DUE:** March 25, 2019, Noon.

## Before You Begin

This visualizations should be built utilize `template.html` from your [`exercise-portfolio`](https://github.com/umiami-data-viz/exercise-portfolio).


## Instructions

You have been provided four data sets in the `data` directory:

- `AAPL.csv`
- `AMZN.csv`
- `FB.csv`
- `GOOG.csv`

Using these, you will create one **line chart** and one **area chart** using [d3](https://d3js.org/).

Each visualization should be in a separate file (i.e. `line-chart.html`, `area-chart.html`) in your exercise portfolio.

You may mix-and-match which data set you want to use a visualization, but you *must* use different data sets. (For instance, if you choose to create a line chart using `AAPL.csv`, you must use one of the other three data sets for the area chart.)

Make sure each visualization has all required details (i.e. a title, text description, labels, axes, etc.) — not just the data!

In both cases, chart the **Close** price of the stock over time.

You must also include:

- A line which intersects with the highest closing price of the stock. Identify the purpose of this line with a label.

- Four points and labels indicating specific events. Please see information in the next section for details on which events to plot.

- The beginning/end of the Obama administration. (You could indicate this with vertical lines at the respective dates or create a rectangle with a contrasting background.) Be sure to include labels depending on which approach you take.


### Data Sets

Each data set presents unique information. Below is a breakdown of the events you are to identify with points (circles) and labels on the line/area chart. Be sure to include a small line which connects the text to the point. See `data-point-with-label.png` in the `assets` directory for an example of how this should be executed.

## Submitting Your Work

**Email Prof. Brown with a link to your exercise portfolio no later than March 25, 2019, Noon.**

Late submissions or incomplete exercises will receive a zero (0).


## Review

Profs. Brown and Figueroa will randomly select students on March 25 to go over your visualizations in class.

Students are expected to make notes of improvements to be completed before the final submission of the portfolio is due at the end of the semester. Exercises which remain unchanged will receive deductions.

Even if you are not selected, it is recommended you take notes on what can be improved in the visualizations presented as it may relate to your own work.


## Reminder

Students are expected to complete these visualizations individually. Do not copy/paste code from notes, exercises or the book. **Your code is expected to be unique.**

Students who have identical (or near-identical) code will earn a zero on the assignment when portfolios are graded.

**Good luck!**
